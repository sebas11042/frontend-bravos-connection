# Frontend Project in Next.js

This project is a frontend application built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), following the principles of **Screaming Architecture** to maintain clean, modular, and scalable code. It can be run using either `pnpm` or `npm` and runs on port `3000` by default.

## 📌 Requirements

- Node.js `>= 18.x`
- pnpm `>= 8.x` (optional) or npm `>= 9.x`

pnpm dev
```

### With npm:
